# Milestone Document

**[Project Statement : Quiz-Master-App-V1](https://github.com/jishnukoliyadan/Quiz-Master-App-V1/blob/main/Problem-Statement.md)**

The milestones are divided into **Core Requirements**, **Recommended Functionalities**, and **Optional Enhancements**. Students can complete any core milestone(1-7) in any order but recommended and optional (milestone 8-11) need to be done only after the core is completed. Each milestone includes a **brief explanation** and a **Git commit message** to track progress. When you finish a milestone, use the exact Git commit message given in every milestone to save your work. Then, push the changes to GitHub to update the online version of your project.
